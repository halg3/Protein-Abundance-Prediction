# Protein-Abundance-Prediction

This is a random forest machine learning model that can be used to predict protein abundance. There are 6 required pieces of information: 1. mRNA sequences (.fa.gz format), 2. 3' and 5' UTR regions (.bed file), 3. RNA abundance (.csv file), 4. Translation information (.csv file), 5. Protein abundance (.csv file), and 6. File matching cell line to its experimental alias (.csv file).

To maximize ease of use, I would recommend downloading the .qmd file and opening it on RStudios. Instructions with how to use are outlined within the .qmd document. One could expect for this code to take around 3-4 hours to execute.
